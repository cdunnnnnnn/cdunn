We wanted to build an app using the latest in client side solutions to give our readers an immersive experience when navigating our award &amp; recognition programs. On the backend I developed a JSON api on top of our serverside CMS, then used [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/) on the frontend to iterate over the data. Users are now able to apply filters to the list, visit detailed bio views and quickly switch between different program/year views.
