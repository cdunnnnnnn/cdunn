This was a design &amp; development project for the new BadgeUp SaaS product landing page. We created all new designs and iterated on their established branding. The new site is managed with [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) and uses [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) for it's grid system.
